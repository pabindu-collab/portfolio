## How to use

1. **Edit `index.html`:**
   - Replace "Your Name", "your@email.com", and project info.
   - Add your own photo in `/images/your-photo.jpg`.
   - Add project screenshots to `/images/`.

2. **Customize `style.css`** as you like.

3. **Deploy on GitHub Pages:**
   - Push these files to your GitHub repo.
   - Go to repo Settings → Pages → set source to `main` branch and `/ (root)`.
   - Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/reponame`.

4. **Connect your Namecheap domain:**
   - In your repo, create a file called `CNAME` (no extension).
   - Inside, put only your domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com`).
   - On Namecheap, set a DNS record: `CNAME @ yourusername.github.io.`  
   - Wait a bit for DNS to update (can take an hour or more).
